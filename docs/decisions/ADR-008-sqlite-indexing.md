# ADR-008: SQLite for Metadata Indexing

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The application needs to support complex "time-aware" and "size-aware" searches (e.g., "files from last week"). Real-time monitoring only provides events, not a queryable history.

## Decision
Use SQLite as a lightweight persistent index for file metadata.

## Alternatives Considered
- **In-Memory JSON**:
  - Pros: Simple.
  - Cons: High RAM usage for large directories; persistence is slow (rewrite whole file).
- **Elasticsearch/Lucene**:
  - Pros: Powerful search.
  - Cons: Total overkill; massive dependency footprint.

## Rationale
SQLite is built-in to Python, serverless, and extremely efficient at querying relational data. It allows the NLP engine to translate user intent into standard SQL queries without scanning the disk every time.

## Consequences
- **Benefits**: Near-instant search responses, decoupled from actual disk I/O.
- **Limitations**: Database and disk can occasionally drift if manual changes happen while the app is off; mitigated by 'Initial Sync'.
